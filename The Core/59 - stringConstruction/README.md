# Description

Given two strings a and b, both consisting only of lowercase English letters, your task is to calculate how many strings equal to a can be constructed using only letters from the string b? Each letter can be used only once and in one string only.

# Example

For a = "abc" and b = "abccba", the output should be stringsConstruction(a, b) = 2.

We can construct 2 strings a = "abc" using only letters from the string b.

For a = "ab" and b = "abcbcb", the output should be stringsConstruction(a, b) = 1.
